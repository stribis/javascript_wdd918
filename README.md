### :calendar: Week 3
#### Day 1
* :notebook: Lesson
  1. Functions - Function declarations, expressions and more: `function example(){}` 
  2. Objects - Object structure, methods and object literals: `let myObj = { }` 
* :hammer_and_wrench: Exercises
  1. Repetition 1: Switch Case number guesser exercise
  2. Exercise 1: Handling JSON Data
#### Day 2

### :calendar: Week 4
#### Day 1
* :notebook: Lesson
  1. DOM Manipulation : Introduced some basics of DOM Element selection like `getElementById()`, `getElementsByClassName()`, `getElementsByTagName()`, `documentQuerySelector()` & `document.querySelectorAll()`. In addition to changing the style property with `element.style.property = `  
* :hammer_and_wrench: Exercises
  1. Huge repetition exercise that goes over most of the JS we have seen  so far
#### Day 2
* :notebook: Lesson
  1. We checked out ES6 variable scope with `let` and `const`
  2. We looked into template strings (template literals) and worked with interpolation using backticks \`\` and `${variable}` 
  3. We continued looking into DOM manipulation this time looking into creating new elements and changing the content of existing elements with: `document.createElement()`, `element.appendChild()` & `element.innerHTML = ''`
* :hammer_and_wrench: Exercises
  1. Click event Exercise: Using a click event, create an insert new elements into an already existing element, and remove element from an already existing element:  `element.addEventListener('click', function(){//code})`

---

### :calendar: Week 5
#### Day 1
* :notebook: Lesson
  1. Click events and Input events: Checked out `addEventListener()` and the event object returned in the callback function
  2. More events: reviewed a couple of other events like `mouseOver`, `keyPressed` and more
* :hammer_and_wrench: Exercises
  1. Story Exercise. Create an interactive story by reading input information after a click event
#### Day 2
* :notebook: Lesson
  1. Form Validation: We checked out how to validate a small form, and worked with function, conditionals, loops, events and many other things!
* :hammer_and_wrench: Exercises
  1. No exercise
